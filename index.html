                        I was never particularly good at maths before year 11 of my highschool. I wasn't bad either, I
                        was just mediocre. I memorized the formulas and did what my teacher told me in certain
                        questions. It was as if they wanted me to use just a different cookie-cutter answer for a
                        particular question. I didn't understand much intuitively, that is before I met an extremely
                        passionate teacher that was actually interested in making us think creatively about the given
                        problem. That teacher's perspective on brought about a revolution in how I think and that I
                        found maths genuinely interesting. Her method was as follows; Spend a lot of time laying the
                        foundations by starting from scratch and not assume that everybody knows the basics. Then start
                        by working through a typical problem in the given topic with everybody and then start
                        introducing irregularities in said problems to promote more involve critical thinking to come up
                        with a creative solution. Every one of those problems was unique and required a unique approach.
                        The best way to teach people is to first lay down the fundamental knowledge and then guide them
                        through the curveball questions so that next time they would be able to come up with a solution
                        themselves.

                        Speaking about myself, I used to go to the gym at least three times a day before Covid-19 came
                        around. Though gyms are now open again, I have some fears about whether it is safe to go to the
                        gym and whether I ever needed it? Over the lockdown, I bought a pair of dumbells of my preferred
                        weight from amazon and arguably I've gotten similar results to what I was getting at the gym
                        with very little equipment. My favourite sport is basketball and I enjoy playing it with my
                        friends or just joining random people that are playing in the park. Lastly, I enjoy playing with
                        computer hardware, things like building a pc from scratch or building a smart thermostat with an
                        Arduino board and some sensors excited me from as early as 13. And this hobby may benefit me in
                        my desired job, doing something that you like and it benefits you is the greatest position you
                        can have.

                        My career aspirations are in software development. I am pretty sure that is the sector I want to
                        have a career in. Though I am not sure about which area to specialize for example in front end
                        development or back end. So I have been trying all aspects of software development to get a
                        taste of what specific career paths have to offer. I am confident with using C#, Python and JS,
                        and I know the basics of Java. My online portfolio as a software developer can be found by
